# Usage
Go to Module, Pathology.

Click "Load data directly from file" to select an image.

Click the button labeled Quick TCGA Effect.
This adds a palette to the interface where you can change the parameters of the run.

Click segmentation button to run an algorithm over the image with the current parameters.
Hit the "Y" key to continue.

After a few moments itâ€™ll come back segmented.

Left-click & drag to select a subregion.
Now you can run the function on that area only.
